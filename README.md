# BrutePy
Python Brute Force for Http Auth

BrutePy is a tool that can be used to Brute Force a target that requires HTTP Auth.


**Usage**

```
python Brute.py "path to wordlist" "optional start line"
```

Currently BrutePy targets 192.168.1.1 statically.

Some things I'd like to do:

 1. Handle arguments better
 2. Allow passing in of target
 3. Allow configurable delay
